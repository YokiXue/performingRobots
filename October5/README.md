*Material:Introduction from The Freudian Robot: Digital Media and the Future of the Unconscious by Lydia H. Liu*


In this week's reading, Lydia raised the question of whether physiological deficiencies of the human species are in need of prosthetic extension through technology, specifically robots. She did not give a clear answer, but briefly discussed two types of relationships between humans and robots. One is the prosthetic view that machines are only an extension of humans. By storing the key patterns underlying human knowledge, skills, and personality, robots thereby eliminate most causes of death and help human history become immortal. The transformational viewpoint, on the other hand, suggests that not only do human-machine interactions exist but that machines affect the human senses, thus changing the way humans perceive the external world. 

Are humans and machines placed on opposing sides or on a united front? Do human beings become masters of their machines or their slaves? The questions she then raised remind me of Hegel's Master-Slave Dialectic which signifies two self-consciousnesses in a relation: slaves become experiential gainers of the outside world in punitive labor, and acquire more productive experience as they continue to satisfy their masters' consumption needs. Over time, the slave becomes desperate for self-conscious recognition, while the dependent master is more likely to become a slave, reversing the master-slave relationship.
