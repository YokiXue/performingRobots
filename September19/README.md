*Material: On Stage: Robots as Performers by Guy Hoffman*


This week's reading "On Stage: Robots as Performers" though does not present a very novel argument to me, I strongly agree with the author's emphasis on the critical role of fine-tuned timing and coordinated responsiveness in the robotic theater. In our daily life, if there is a misalignment in the timing, it's very likely to make people distracted and even produce socially awkward feelings, so the subtle adjustments in the timing can make the audience believe that the robot actor can understand whatâ€™s going on. One advantage of robots over real person actors is that they inherently avoid psychological nervousness - they can be programmed by the improvisational algorithm to demonstrate the natural duration of pause and exact tempo of the utterance.

The inner monologue technique is also very interesting, which enables robots to interact more flexibly with their environment, other actors, and the audience. I can see how it is an effective way to increase robot anthropomorphism as it is associated with the current mental state and personal characteristics.
