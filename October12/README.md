*Material: Thinking Something Makes It So’: Performing Robots, the Workings of Mimesis and the Importance of Character By Louise LePage*



I found the idea of stage robots' capacity to challenge humanistic beliefs, which underpins dramatic structure, to be very intriguing. We have seen so many examples of how robot performance is still based on human-centered ideology and knowledge. What the robot does either resembles human behavior or echo with most people's expectation, but what if the robot has "a relationship with life and death, sensory pleasures, sex, time, memory" that run counter to the humanist perspective? I can understand the pioneering nature of the field in terms of research and experimentation, but for commercial and entertaining performances, If a play or story has mainly object-orientated ontology, would it threaten the view experience and the attachment of the audience? It was also discussed in previous reading that if what the robot actors do does not demand attention (i.e. they act beyond the boundaries of human understanding), the performance will become repellent and people will look away.

Questions:

1. How do the robots with more mundane and quotidian forms affect people's perception and attitude towards whose performing on the stage?

2. What does it mean to de-centralize the humanist perspective and framework in robot performance? Does it require zero anthropomorphism?
